# Begin-Your-Adventure
<p>Welcome to the README for my first game. I've started this project for practice, but it is incredibly fun once you get going!</p>
<p>There are specific commands you need to type to do anything in the game. You must type with the command first and then an item or location after. For example, in the game, You can only use 'go to', 'look', 'use', or 'pick up'.</p>
<p>If you wanted to leave the room, you must type where you are going. "go to bathroom" will take you to the bathroom. "look" will make you look at the room you are in with more detail. "use dresser" will make you open the dresser.</p>

<p> If you have any ideas, please share them!<br> Have fun! Hope you enjoy! </p>


**Functions that still need to be added:**
<ul>
  <li>Sound</li>
  <li>More use functions</li>
  <li>perhaps another chapter</li>
</ul>
